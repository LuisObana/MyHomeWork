# What is BEC?

Business Email Compromise (BEC) is commonly used umbrella term for digital corporate fraud schemes and is a bit misleading since technically it does not compromise anyone’s email for fraud, if we are to understand that compromised means unauthorized access or hacking someone else’s email account [1]. This type of fraud is not limited to business email, Elias Alanko mentioned on his presentation, this type of hackers can also use private email, phone calls, SMS, social media apps and even physical email can also fall under this category. 

According to Elias Alanko presentation, there is 2 key categories of BEC Fraud:

        •	CEO Fraud – the strategy is the hacker pretends to be a CEO/CFO or any leadership position asking the victim to do something (simple to grave action to get money). The term is also used often as an umbrella term in Finland although it is just one of the key corporate fraud schemes. During his discussion on this type of fraud, the examples was pretty much simple. It was not technical, or does it require a lot of information, it was simple, convincing and deadly. But why was it convincing? First I think from what I understood is that no one is expecting a very simple approach to be used in fraud or hacking, everyone is expecting a robust or techy type of approach hence being simple will pass. Second is, humans as we are, our desire to help (compassionate and empathy) makes as an easy target even if the approach is very elementary. 
        
        •	Invoice Fraud – the type scheme of used is “requesting to change in supplier details” through email. This type of approach is often called Pre-texting. The fraudster try to connect with the people involved (information and details from LinkedIN) and studies their email threads. (Pre-texting is different from phishing, since it is a social engineering attack type where no credential is required) (Phishing – is a social engineering attack type where attackers want to gain access to credentials that they can use). If you are not a technical person or someone trained in security by your company (trained in security meaning you are provided training, review and on the spot checking to ensure you are familiar with the latest information on hacking or fraudster) it will be hard for you to spot the difference or to get the feeling that your are being hacked or a fraudster is attacking you. 

To both type or scenario, emails are constructed normally that you would not spot the difference. This is the same approach we had at my previous company. I worked at a consulting firm, and we have this security exam every month. Where emails are purposely sent to us if we are attentive, conscious on the emails that we read and respond on a daily basis. We need to identify the fraud or phishing (we categorize it as phishing even if the approach is similar as BEC). Some of the factors  we have to look at is email address, subject, tone of the body of the email, urgency or even those where we are asked to click some links on the body of the email. If we do not pass this test we are enrolled on PIP regarding security for 6 months, and if we failed again there is disciplinary action and also we need to pass for 3 succeeding months. It was a good training as it was able to help us identify potential cyber threats. 

During the discussion, he provided a more sophisticated example of fraud. It was not technical; it was just that the fraudster really studied his victims. He looks them up or probably conducted research hence he was able to justify his pretense and no one noticed (not the supplier and finance team). It was a simple (like I mentioned earlier) and it definitely work. Sometime the would attempt to hijack emails as it is more easier, but then as technology evolves, MFA was implemented which makes it more difficult to acquire or hijack applications which requires authentication.
