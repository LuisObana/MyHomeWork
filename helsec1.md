# What is BEC?

Business Email Compromise (BEC) is commonly used umbrella term for digital corporate fraud schemes and is a bit misleading since technically it does not compromise anyone’s email for fraud, if we are to understand that compromised means unauthorized access or hacking someone else’s email account [1]. This type of fraud is not limited to business email, Elias Alanko mentioned on his presentation, this type of hackers can also use private email, phone calls, SMS, social media apps and even physical email can also fall under this category.
